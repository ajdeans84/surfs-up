# Surfs Up

## Project Overview
Before too hastily jumping into a business venture, let's analyze the weather data from Oahu to make sure our Shake n' Surf shop will perform well enough there to maintain the costs of moving to Hawaii. 

By using the Hawaii.sqlite file (see 'Resources' folder), we can create a link to the local database and extract the data to perform our analysis. Daily temperatures were retrieved for the months of June and December to compare what the weather will be like in the summer and the winter. 

## Results
There are several key differences between the weather in Oahu in June and December.

## Summary

### What did we learn?
//High level summary of results
As W. Avy gets ready to commit to opening up the Shake n' Surf ice cream surfing shop, he can make an informed decision knowing that the daily temperatures in Oahu do not vary greatly between June and December. The average temperature in December is only 4 degrees lower than in June, and the max temperature is only two degrees lower, meaning that this business venture is sound year-round. The minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees, which may be slightly too cold for casual ice cream fans, but it would not deter true ice cream connoisseurs. Likewise for surfers, the similar temperature across months is not enough to significantly impact the number of customers interested in surfing. He should not expect too much of a dip in sales in the winter months, according to our weather analysis. 

### Future Considerations

//Additional query to perform to gather more weather data for June and December
We can examine the precipitation in the summer and winter. Although the temperatures are relatively similar, can December visitors expect more or less rain than June visitors? Is there a significant change in rainfall that would deter customers from surfing or eating ice cream?
