# Surfs Up

## Project Overview
Before too hastily jumping into a business venture, let's analyze the weather data from Oahu to make sure our Shake n' Surf shop will perform well enough there to maintain the costs of moving to Hawaii. 

By using the Hawaii.sqlite file (see 'Resources' folder), we can create a link to the local database and extract the data to perform our analysis. Daily temperatures were retrieved for the months of June and December to compare what the weather will be like in the summer and the winter. 

## Results
There are several key differences between the weather in Oahu in June and December.
